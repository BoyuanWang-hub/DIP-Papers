# Digital-Image-Processing-Essays

## In this project, I have reproduced six classical papers and finally a demo is presented.

The total six papers reproduced are showing below:

```ruby
|  No. | Paper  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| 1  | PatchMatch: A Randomized Correspondence Algorithm for Structural Image Editing |
| 2  | Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing |
| 3  | Image Deformation Using Moving Least Squares |
| 4  | Edge-Preserving Decompositions for Multi-Scale Tone and Detail Manipulation |
| 5  | Edge-preserving Multiscale Image Decomposition based on Local Extrema |
| 6  | “GrabCut” — Interactive Foreground Extraction using Iterated Graph Cuts |
```

## How to Run this Demo?
